# Rxf1Angular

A simple project to study the concepts of reactive components using RxJS and the F1 API.

In this project I basically focused on implementing two RxJs patterns:
- Retrieving data pattern
- Retrieving data on action pattern

Both patterns use a combination of the Async Pipe and action streams to simplify data requests.

You can find more information about these patterns on this article that I wrote on Medium where I discuss each implementation on more details:

## From seasons 2021 to 2023 on this project, you can:
- consult list of Drivers per season.
- consult list of Races per season with final results and championship standings results.
