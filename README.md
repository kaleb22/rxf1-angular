# 🏆 RxF1 - Angular

RxF1 Angular is a simple project to study the concepts of reactive components using RxJS and the F1 API.

## 🌟 Angular topics adressed

- Using angular material library
- Implementing cache with ng-http-cache library

In this project I basically focused on implementing two RxJs patterns:

- Retrieving data pattern
- Retrieving data on action pattern

Both patterns use a combination of the Async Pipe and action streams to simplify data requests.

You can find more information about these patterns on this article that I wrote on Medium where I discuss each implementation on more details:

The project was originally developed with Angular v14. Recently I updated the project to Angular v19 to adress the following topics:

- Standalone components
- Signals
- Angular cli schematics to update project
- Using angular material library

## 🏎️ From seasons 2021 to 2025 on this project, you can:

- consult list of Drivers per season.
- consult list of Races per season with final results and championship standings results.

## 👌 Live preview
